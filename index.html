The map above is a world map that shows how happy the country is depending on the colour.
The brighter the colour, the happier the country is. <br>
People might have the false understanding that USA which ranks 13th in terms of happiness is the happiest 
country in the world as all of the movies are usually filmed in USA which shows their wealth in <br>
cities such as New York, Los Angeles and San Fransisco. However, they do not show the other side of the
community such as the homeless and the people who are struggling to even pay their rent. <br>
The happiest country in the world is Denmark. The reasons why the Danes is so happy is because
of their social equality and their community spirit. They also have tuition-free education <br>
which might contribute to their happiness. One survey says that they are more than happy to
pay taxes as they have a lot of trust in their government and they are happy with how the <br>
government spend the tax money.
