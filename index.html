The data is based on 157 countries out of 195 countries in the world.

<p>
This might be caused by the non existing data of smaller countries such as Vatican City and Holy Sea and other countries such as North Korea and Cuba.

The visualization below will be helpful to the audience as it allows them to know which countries are the happiest in the world and what makes the people <br>
is a country happier than others.

The map above is a world map that shows how happy the country is depending on the colour. <b>The brighter the colour, the happier the country is. </b> <br>
People might have the false understanding that <b> USA </b> which ranks 13th in terms of happiness is the happiest country in the world as all of the <br>
movies are usually filmed in <b> USA </b> which shows their wealth in cities such as <b> New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco. </b> However, they do not show <br>
the other side of the community such as the homeless and the people who are struggling to even pay their rent.

The happiest country in the world is <b> Denmark </b>. The reasons why the <b> Danes </b> is so happy is because of their <b> social equality and their community spirit. </b> <br>
They also have <b> tuition-free education </b> which might contribute to their happiness. One survey says that they are more than happy to pay taxes as they <br>
have a lot of <b> trust in their government </b> and they are happy with how the government spend the tax money. Thus, the trust in their government which might <br>
contribute to their happiness.

<p>
The scatterplot above shows us that as the <b> healthcare quality increases, the happiness score increases. </b> We can use the region selection to filter <br>
different regions such as Western Europe, North America, Eastern Asia and many more. This will help the user to see which region has a good healthcare <br>
quality. Filtering by region will also show the audience that the countries in the same region will be in the similar position in the plot unless the <br>
country is at war like <b> Syria/Afghanistan. </b> 
</p>
<font size="+1.5">
<p>
At the top of the scatterplot, we can see <b> Hongkong and Singapore. </b> These countries has similar healthcare quality but there is a <b> gap in their happiness score. </b> <br>
This might be caused by other problems in <b> Hongkong </b> such as the <b> population density and their political unstability with China. </b> At the bottom left, we have <br>
<b> Burundi </b> which have low healthcare quality and thus might be one of the reason why they are the least happiest country in the world. <br>
</p>

<p>
The bar graph above shows the correlation between <b> freedom and happiness </b> in each country. Freedom is limited in some country such as China and thus <b> some people <br>
might value freedom more than other people who lives in other country. </b> The filter is set at 0.5 as the default as we do not want to make the graph too long. <br>
If the filter is set to 0, the graph will display all of the countries and the correlation between happiness and freedom sorted from highest to lowest. <br>
<b> High correlation means that the more freedom that is given to the citizens the happier the citizens are. Low correlation means that freedom does not have much <br>
impact on how happy they are. </b> <br>
</p>
<font size="+1.5">
<p>
At the top of the bar is <b> Uzbekistan </b> which makes sense as they are pretty restricted in terms of freedom of speech and freedom in general. They do not get to <br>
elect their president which holds the most power. They are one of the countries was part of the USSR and thus they still have some of the practice where they do <br>
not allow much freedom of speech. They are also labelled as "abysmal" in terms of human rights by Human Rights Watch. They also received heavy criticism from other <br>
countries for their human rights violation.
</p>
<font size="+1.5">
<p>
The second country with highest correlation is <b> Norway. </b> Norway is one of best countries in terms of government transparency and freedom of speech. An example of this <br>
is that the Norwegian football team is protesting againsts Qatar, the host of the 2022 World Cup for violating human rights. This shows that the citizens of Norway <br>
values freedom and human rights highly. The high correlation can be explained by them being used to having freedom and thus if their freedom is taken away, they <br>
will not be happy. Thus, it shows how much they value their freedom.

<p>
The heatmap above compares the average income of a country with their happiness score. We can see a pattern where as the <b> average income increases, the happiness <br>
score increases. </b> This logically makes sense as the more money someone has, the happier they usually are. They do not have to deal with financial difficulties and <br>
they can afford most of the things they want.
</p>
<font size="+1.5">
<p>
At the top right of the graph, we can see <b> Switzerland. </b> Switzerland is one of the richest country in the world and thus make them one of the happiest. Switzerland <br>
has a lot of banks where millionaires and billionairse all over the world deposit their money. This is because they are a neutral country and thus does not have any <br>
special political relations with any countries. Being a neutral country also means that they have very stable in terms of politics and economy as they do not have <br>
to deal with any political dramas and wars.
